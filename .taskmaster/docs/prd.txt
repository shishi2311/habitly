# Overview  
Habit Timer is a productivity tool that helps users build and maintain positive habits by associating each habit with a customizable timer. The app enables users to set a habit (e.g., "Study 25 min"), track their progress with a daily streak counter, and manage their sessions efficiently. The goal is to encourage consistency and focus through simple, effective time management.

# Core Features  
- **Create Habit with Timer:**  
  Users can define a habit and assign a timer duration (e.g., "Study 25 min", "Read 15 min").
- **Start/Stop Timer:**  
  Users can start or stop the timer for any habit. The timer should be visually prominent and easy to control.
- **Daily Streak Counter:**  
  The app tracks consecutive days the user completes the habit, displaying a streak count to motivate continued engagement.
- **State Management:**  
  Use either Provider or Riverpod for all state management to ensure scalability and maintainability.

# User Experience  
- **User Personas:**  
  - Students aiming to improve study habits  
  - Professionals seeking to build work routines  
  - Anyone wanting to track and reinforce daily habits
- **Key User Flows:**  
  1. Add a new habit with a timer duration  
  2. Start the timer for a habit  
  3. Stop or complete the timer  
  4. View and monitor daily streaks  
- **UI/UX Considerations:**  
  - Minimalist, distraction-free interface  
  - Clear display of timer and streaks  
  - Easy access to start/stop controls

# Technical Architecture  
- **Frontend:** Flutter (mobile-first, cross-platform)
- **State Management:** Provider or Riverpod (choose one and apply consistently)
- **Data Persistence:** Local storage (e.g., SharedPreferences, Hive, or similar) for habits and streaks
- **Timer Logic:** Accurate timer implementation that handles app backgrounding and interruptions
- **Streak Calculation:** Logic to increment streak only once per day per habit, reset if a day is missed

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements:**  
  - Habit creation with timer duration  
  - Start/stop timer functionality  
  - Daily streak counter per habit  
  - Persistent storage for habits and streaks  
  - Basic UI for adding, viewing, and managing habits
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Notifications/reminders  
  - Multiple habits  
  - Analytics and history  
  - Customizable themes

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Implement state management (Provider or Riverpod)
2. Build habit creation and storage logic
3. Implement timer functionality
4. Add streak tracking and calculation
5. Design and build UI for core flows
6. Integrate all components and test

- Prioritize getting a working timer and streak logic for a single habit before expanding to multiple habits or advanced features.

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Timer accuracy:** Use Flutter best practices to ensure timer works reliably even if the app is backgrounded.
- **State consistency:** Thoroughly test state management logic to avoid bugs in streak counting or timer resets.
- **User engagement:** Keep UI simple and motivating; consider adding reminders in future versions.

- **State Management Choice:**  
  Decide between Provider and Riverpod at project start and document rationale.
