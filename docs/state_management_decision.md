# State Management Decision

## Choice: Provider

### Rationale
1. **Simplicity**: Provider offers a straightforward approach to state management, which is suitable for our Habit Timer app's complexity level.
2. **Flutter Integration**: Provider is officially recommended by the Flutter team and has excellent Flutter integration.
3. **Feature Set**: Provides all necessary features for our app:
   - Global state management for habits list
   - Local state management for individual timers
   - Efficient rebuilds for streak updates
   - Simple dependency injection

### Use Cases in Our App
1. **Habits List**: Manage the list of habits globally
2. **Timer State**: Handle individual timer states
3. **Streak Management**: Track and update streak counts
4. **Settings**: Manage app-wide settings (future enhancement)

### Structure
We will organize providers in the following way:
- `lib/providers/` - Directory for all providers
  - `habit_provider.dart` - Manages habits list and operations
  - `timer_provider.dart` - Handles timer state and operations
  - `streak_provider.dart` - Manages streak calculations
